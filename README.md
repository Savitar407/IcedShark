  # Fileless Auditor
  - this program is used to test user compliance with password policies by dumping any passwords saved into the credential manager because a user has auto saved passwords in their browser. This powershell program runs entirely from memory and therefore operates without producing any files as to not alarm users.
  - PLEASE NOTE: THIS PROGRAM SENDS THE EXTRACTION RESULTS TO A PREDEFINED PUBLIC SERVER SETUP FOR TESTING AND NEEDS TO BE CHANGED!!!

# Privesc Batch 
- This program enumerates the local system for possible privilege escalation attack vectors that could be leveraged to gain local admin on a box.
